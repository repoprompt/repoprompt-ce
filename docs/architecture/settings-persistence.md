# Settings Persistence

Current as of 2026-06-21. This document is contributor-facing: use it when changing durable settings, workspace overrides, Agent Models settings, or MCP settings surfaces.

## Durable settings file

RepoPrompt CE stores app settings in the versioned JSON document at:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/RepoPrompt CE/Settings/globalSettings.json
```

The schema is represented by `GlobalSettingsDocument` in `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/Settings/Models/GlobalSettingsDocument.swift`. Schema v4 adds workspace-scoped Agent Models profiles while keeping existing global fields as the backing store for the global profile.

The settings manager rejects saves for future schema versions and uses in-memory defaults for that launch. This protects newer settings files from older app builds.

## Agent Models profiles

Agent Models settings cover the controls shown on Settings → Agent Models:

- Oracle model (`planningModelRaw`)
- Built-in Chat model (`preferredComposeModelRaw`)
- Oracle ↔ Built-in Chat sync toggle
- Context Builder agent/model
- MCP sub-agent role defaults
- MCP role-label discovery filtering

These fields are grouped in `AgentModelsSettingsProfile`.

### Global profile

The global Agent Models profile is not a separate JSON blob. It is projected from existing durable fields:

| Profile field | Backing setting |
| --- | --- |
| `planningModelRaw` | `scalarPreferences.modelSelection.planningModel` |
| `preferredComposeModelRaw` | `scalarPreferences.modelSelection.preferredComposeModel` |
| `syncChatModelWithOracle` | `scalarPreferences.modelSelection.syncChatModelWithOracle` |
| `contextBuilderAgentRaw` | `globalDefaults.discoverAgentRaw` |
| `contextBuilderModelsByAgent` | `globalDefaults.discoverModelsByAgent` |
| `mcpAgentRoleOverrides` | `globalDefaults.mcpAgentRoleOverrides` |
| `restrictMCPAgentDiscoveryToRoleLabels` | `scalarPreferences.agentMode.restrictMCPAgentDiscoveryToRoleLabels` |

Use `GlobalSettingsStore.globalAgentModelsProfile()` and `setGlobalAgentModelsProfile(_:contextBuilderWriteIntent:)` for whole-profile reads/writes. The write intent distinguishes user-owned Context Builder changes from automatic seeding while allowing unrelated model changes to preserve the existing ownership marker. User-driven Context Builder edits and workspace-to-global copies mark the selection as user-defined; automatic seeding stores an explicit unmarked state and never demotes an established user choice.

Legacy global Context Builder setters and global backing-field writers for planning, Built-in Chat, sync, MCP role overrides, and role-label discovery filtering post `.agentModelsSettingsDidChange(scope: .global)` after an actual value change because they mutate fields used by the global Agent Models profile.

### Workspace profiles

Workspace-specific Agent Models settings are stored in:

```swift
GlobalSettingsDocument.agentModelsSettingsByWorkspaceID
```

Each entry is a `WorkspaceAgentModelsSettings` value:

- `inheritanceMode: .useGlobalSettings | .useWorkspaceOverrides`
- `profile: AgentModelsSettingsProfile?`

A workspace in `.useGlobalSettings` resolves to the global profile even if it has an inactive saved profile. Switching to `.useWorkspaceOverrides` materializes a complete workspace profile from the current global profile when none exists. This keeps override editing deterministic and avoids partial per-field fallback rules.

`WindowSettingsManager` forwards scoped Agent Models reads/writes to `GlobalSettingsStore`; it does not create a window-local overlay for these settings.

Durable Agent Models profile values use trim-only normalization: surrounding whitespace and empty strings are normalized, but unknown nonempty provider identifiers, model identifiers, and map keys are preserved for forward and rollback compatibility. Catalog validation and executable fallback belong at runtime; loading or saving the settings document must not replace unknown durable values with current defaults.

## Effective runtime resolution

Runtime consumers should read the effective profile instead of directly reading scattered global fields or legacy workspace Context Builder fields:

```swift
GlobalSettingsStore.effectiveAgentModelsProfile(workspaceID:)
```

Resolution order:

1. No workspace ID → global profile.
2. Missing workspace settings → global profile.
3. Workspace set to `.useGlobalSettings` → global profile.
4. Workspace set to `.useWorkspaceOverrides` with a profile → workspace profile.

The following runtime surfaces use this effective profile:

- `PromptViewModel` for Oracle/Built-in Chat model settings.
- `ContextBuilderAgentViewModel` for Context Builder agent/model selection.
- `MCPAgentRoleDefaultsService` and MCP agent tools for role-label defaults in the active workspace.
- `AutoRecommendationEngine` for recommendation satisfaction and apply targets.

Context Builder discovery budget, enhancement mode, clarifying-question behavior, and related per-workspace discovery options remain in workspace chat settings. Only the Context Builder agent/model selection moved into Agent Models profiles.

## Change notifications

Scoped Agent Models writes post:

```swift
Notification.Name.agentModelsSettingsDidChange
```

Payload keys are defined by `AgentModelsSettingsNotification`:

- `scope`: `global` or `workspace`
- `workspaceID`: included for workspace changes

Global changes refresh all Agent Models projections. Workspace changes should refresh only consumers bound to that workspace. Consumers should then re-read through `effectiveAgentModelsProfile(workspaceID:)`.

## MCP `app_settings` scope

The MCP `app_settings` surface remains global for model-related keys such as:

- `models.planning_model`
- `models.preferred_compose_model`
- `context_builder.agent`
- `context_builder.model`

Those keys write the global backing fields. Workspace-specific Agent Models overrides are not exposed through `app_settings`; they are selected by the active RepoPrompt workspace/window and resolved by runtime services.

## Non-goals and migration notes

- Do not resurrect the old Context Builder drift resolver. Agent Models and runtime code should use the effective Agent Models profile, not compare against legacy `ChatGlobalSettings.contextBuilder*` fields.
- Do not add a second global Agent Models blob unless there is a separate migration plan; the global profile intentionally maps to existing fields.
- Existing workspaces default to `Use global settings`. Workspace overrides are opt-in and materialized from the current global profile.
